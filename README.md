# Rock vs Mine Prediction
This project is a Machine Learning classification model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of a supervised learning project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.


📌 Project Overview

•	Built using Python and Google Colab.

•	Uses the SONAR dataset (commonly used for binary classification tasks).

•	Compares performance of different machine learning algorithms.

•	Provides step-by-step explanations to make it beginner-friendly.


🚀 Features

•	Data loading and exploration

•	Data preprocessing and splitting

•	Model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)

•	Accuracy evaluation on training and test sets

•	Prediction on new input data


🛠️ Tech Stack

•	Language: Python in Google Colab

•	Libraries:
    o	NumPy
    o	Pandas
    o	Scikit-learn


📊 Dataset


The dataset consists of sonar signals bounced off different surfaces.

•	Label "R" → Rock

•	Label "M" → Mine

If you don’t already have the dataset, you can download it from [Connectionist Bench (Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks) - UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks)


📈 Results

•	The trained model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between rocks and mines.

•	Accuracy may vary slightly depending on train-test split.


🔮 Future Improvements

•	Try deep learning models (ANNs, CNNs).

•	Apply hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

•	Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit for real-world usage.
